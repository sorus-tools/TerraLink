# TerraLink at a Glance

- Pick your input layer of fragmented patches. This could be a raster LULC dataset or a vector set of polygon patches. 

- Set an output folder unless you intentionally want a temporary layer.

- If using raster data, tell TerraLink which value(s) you would like to define as patches.

- Set key criteria such as minimum patch size, optimization mode and your budget. 

- Optimization modes: **Largest Single Network**, **Most Connected Area**, **Landscape Fluidity**, and **Reachable Habitat**.
- **Most Connected Area** maximizes total habitat contained in the final connected networks, then uses remaining budget without reducing that objective.
- **Landscape Fluidity** improves internal mobility by adding corridors that meaningfully reduce detours and increase shortcut efficiency.
- **Reachable Habitat** maximizes gain in reachable habitat within a species dispersal distance, so results depend strongly on movement scale and any patch-quality weighting you choose.

- Enable **Impassable Land Classes** when there are areas that corridors must avoid (roads, water, cities). Set values for this in raster, or select impassable polygon layers in vector mode.

- Keep the search distance reasonable—oversized values slow things down.

- If performance is slow, resample very fine rasters or trim your AOI before running.

- The output data comes embedded with helpful info. Raster corridor cells can be assigned in three ways (`Assign corridor cells`):
  - `Sum area of patches directly connected`: value is patch1 area + patch2 area (pixels).
  - `Sum area of total network`: value is total connected network area (pixels) after corridor inclusion.
  - `Efficiency (corridor area / connected patches)`: value is corridor area divided by (patch1 area + patch2 area) (unitless).
  Vector corridor attributes include patch ids, corridor area, connected area, and efficiency. 
- Vector runs also create a contiguous areas layer (patches + corridors dissolved by network).
- Raster and vector runs add summary table layers in QGIS, and vector runs also write a summary CSV.
- Landscape metrics reports are written alongside outputs as `landscape_metrics_<input layer>.txt`.
